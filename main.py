# h=height, it's near the size of the text itself in this case 12 which looks more neat
# align argument here we have L which means it align from left
# ln is line, if its 1 then the next cell will be in the next line
# if ln is 0 then it will be added after the width ends which looks like ghost print
# (R,G,B) depends on combination we get colors
